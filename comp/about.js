            The dynamics of the workplace have totally changed in the last decade and more so after the pandemic, global teams that are flexible and agile have become the norm. Most of the current job search/freelancing platforms were conceived a few decades ago when the situation was different. These are too cumbersome, slow, and inefficient to effectively meet current-day requirements not only of the employers/ hirers but also of those who wish to find workÂ painlessly.
